# 🧮 Calculator – The Odin Project Foundations

This project is part of the [Foundations Path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) from **The Odin Project**.

## 📚 Project Goal

The original assignment required:

- Building a basic calculator using JavaScript  
- Handling operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- Using buttons for input instead of typing directly  
- Displaying results and updating the screen dynamically  
- Organizing code into small, readable functions

## ✨ My Personal Touch

In addition to meeting the basic requirements, I added several improvements:

- ✅ Fully styled UI with a **clean dark theme**
- ✅ Support for decimal input and **prevention of multiple dots**
- ✅ Logic for handling **initial zero and reset state**
- ✅ `DEL` button to remove characters one by one  
- ✅ Support for **chaining operations** after pressing `=`
- ✅ Display shows **"Ans"** when showing the result of the last calculation
- ✅ All logic written in **vanilla JavaScript**

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## 📝 Status

✅ Project complete and functional.  
Minor bugs may be present (e.g. advanced edge cases), but the core logic is solid and working as expected.  
This was a valuable learning experience in DOM manipulation, conditional logic, and state management.
