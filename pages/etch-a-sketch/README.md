# 🎨 Etch-A-Sketch – The Odin Project Foundations

This project is part of the [Foundations Path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) from **The Odin Project**.

## 📚 Project Goal

The original assignment required:

- Using JavaScript to dynamically manipulate the DOM  
- Applying mouse events to draw on a grid  
- Creating a variable-sized grid based on user input  
- Drawing via `mouseover` events (hover)

## ✨ My Personal Touch

In addition to meeting the basic requirements, I added several improvements:

- ✅ Complete UI generated dynamically with JavaScript  
- ✅ Buttons to select black color, random color (via HSL), and eraser (white)  
- ✅ Ability to draw by **click-and-drag** instead of just hovering  
- ✅ **Reset** button to clear the grid without changing its size  
- ✅ Input field with placeholder to define the grid size (1–100)  
- ✅ Clean and responsive UI styled using **Bootstrap 5.3**  
- ✅ **Full mobile interaction support** via touch gestures on phones and tablets  

## 📹 Video Reference

I used the following video as a starting point but implemented many changes and improvements on my own:
