# Rock Paper Scissors – The Odin Project Foundations

This is an interactive Rock Paper Scissors game created as part of the [Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) from **The Odin Project**.

## 📚 Objective

The initial goal was to build the game logic using JavaScript fundamentals. I decided to take it further by adding a complete user interface using DOM manipulation and custom CSS.

## 💡 Personal Enhancements

- Replaced all `prompt()` and `console.log()` interactions with a fully interactive **visual interface**
- Used **DOM manipulation** to dynamically update choices, results, and scoreboards
- Applied **custom CSS** and **Flexbox** to design the layout and style the components
- Included **visual feedback**: green and red text to indicate win/loss
- Created a **"Back to Portfolio"** button for smooth navigation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Flexbox)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- DOM API

## 📝 Status

✅ Completed – Fully functional, responsive, and visually styled game interface.
